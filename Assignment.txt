Pandas
An efficient and fast dataframe object that helps on manipulating data with integrated indexing
It is built for doing pratical data analaysis in Python. It is most powerful and open source for data manipulation.
Python with pandas are used in various field such as finance,statistics,economics and so on.

Numphy
It helps on bringing computational power of C language to python which is much easier to learn and utilize them.
It provides clear and elegant information or solutions. This tools provides siplicity with whole power packed
It is used in quantum computing, statistical computing, image processing and many more.

TensorFlow
It helps to built differnet models for various tasks that includes image recognition, natural language processing, and different computational simulation for equations.
It guides to process effective practices for data automation, performance monitoring and model retraining.
It makes easier to create machine learning which could run in any environment.

Keras
Designed for human beings. helps on reducing cognitive loads.
It minimizes the action done by user for common use cases and it gives clear and actionable error messages.

Pytorch
It is fully framework for creating deep learning models such as image recognition and language processing.
Similar to TensorFlow but both have special advantages.
It is an open source platform for Maching Learning to create deep neural networks.
Easy to use and flexibility

Sklearn
This library has various efficient tools for Machine learning and statistical modeling that include regression, classification, clustering and so on.
tools that can be used for data analaysis
accessible to everyone. built on Numphy
Open source and commerical usable.
